== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to install Booster for WooCommerce (free version)? =

The easiest way to install Booster is via your site’s Dashboard. Please follow these instructions to install and connect Booster:

= Do I need any coding skills to use Booster? =

Absolutely not! You can configure everything Booster has to offer without any coding knowledge.

= What’s the difference between Booster and Paid Booster bundles? =

The free version of Booster for WooCommerce offers 68 amazing features.  But, if you’re looking for greater functionality and even more customization options – Booster Plus is the ultimate WooCommerce product bundle for you. Booster Plus is packed with 196 features and counting. 

Check out our [feature comparison](https://booster.io/booster-woocommerce-free-vs-plus/) and decide which version is best for you.

= Why should I choose paid Booster bundles over other plugins? =

Implementing just a few modules from the Booster paid Booster bundles suite is more cost-effective than using multiple individual plugins, often priced at $79-$99 each.

paid Booster bundles solves all of these problems with over 100 compatible modules in a single package for easy WooCommerce integration. You get multiple custom features for the cost of one WordPress product plugin and the benefit of zero bloat.
