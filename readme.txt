  Bug was not resetting Text labels however (i.e. checkboxes only). Bug was in code since v.1.0.0.
  The bug caused resetting all product's checkbox labels to off, when generally any product save, except "normal" conditions (i.e. saving through standard edit), happened:
  - when any other plugin used `wp_update_post` function,
  - when user updated product via Quick Edit,
  - could be more possible conditions.

= 1.6.2 - 25/09/2014 =
* Feature Upgraded - Orders - Orders Numbers - Additional custom date prefix added. Suggested by Sergio.
  Value is passed directly to PHP `date` function, so most of PHP date formats can be used.
  Visit PHP `date` <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php">function page</a> for more information on valid date formats.
  The only exception is using `\` symbol in date format, as this symbol will be excluded from date (that is because of WooCommerce default option saving mechanism).

= 1.6.1 - 23/09/2014 =
