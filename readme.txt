== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to install Booster for WooCommerce (free version)? =

The easiest way to install Booster is via your site’s Dashboard. Please follow these instructions to install and connect Booster:

= Do I need any coding skills to use Booster? =

Absolutely not! You can configure everything Booster has to offer without any coding knowledge.

= What’s the difference between Booster and Paid Booster bundles? =

The free version of Booster for WooCommerce offers 68 amazing features.  But, if you’re looking for greater functionality and even more customization options – Booster Plus is the ultimate WooCommerce product bundle for you. Booster Plus is packed with 196 features and counting. 

Check out our [feature comparison](https://booster.io/booster-woocommerce-free-vs-plus/) and decide which version is best for you.

= Why should I choose paid Booster bundles over other plugins? =

Implementing just a few modules from the Booster paid Booster bundles suite is more cost-effective than using multiple individual plugins, often priced at $79-$99 each.

paid Booster bundles solves all of these problems with over 100 compatible modules in a single package for easy WooCommerce integration. You get multiple custom features for the cost of one WordPress product plugin and the benefit of zero bloat.

  The bug caused resetting all product's checkbox labels to off, when generally any product save, except "normal" conditions (i.e. saving through standard edit), happened:
  - when any other plugin used `wp_update_post` function,
  - when user updated product via Quick Edit,
  - could be more possible conditions.
* Fix - Custom Price Labels - "Migrate from Custom Price Labels" tool info added to tools dashboard.

= 1.6.2 - 25/09/2014 =
* Feature Upgraded - Orders - Orders Numbers - Additional custom date prefix added. Suggested by Sergio.
  Value is passed directly to PHP `date` function, so most of PHP date formats can be used.
  Visit PHP `date` <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php">function page</a> for more information on valid date formats.
  The only exception is using `\` symbol in date format, as this symbol will be excluded from date (that is because of WooCommerce default option saving mechanism).

= 1.6.1 - 23/09/2014 =
